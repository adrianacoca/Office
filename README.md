This project takes on an initial dataset of offices. Such dataset contains much more data for some countries than others.   
Taking this into account, **California** was chosen as the location for the office because there was a lot of data available and it is one of the top game development cities
  
### The Requirements - Google API:   
  
Though the Google Places API, I was able to find the latitude a longitude of the different requirements. By using the *FindDistances* function, the distance of the closest one was found for each office in the dataset. 
  
### The  Final Decision:
**PicApp: ( 37.794020, -122.403124)**
